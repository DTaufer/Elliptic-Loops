# Elliptic Loops
Hello, and thanks for your interest!

In this folder you find the Magma code to verify the computational claims of our paper (PaperFormalVerification.m).

You also find a basic code to play with the elliptic loops defined over the local rings you like (ConcreteExamples.m).

Should you need to contact us, please write me on name.surname@gmail.com.

Best,
Daniele
